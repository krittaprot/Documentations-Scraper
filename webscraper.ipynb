      "General Guidelines\n",
      "  These guidelines apply to all user communication on kaggle.com (http://kaggle.com) , including Discussions, Notebooks, Datasets, etc. whether private or public.\n",
      "  Nuance is easily lost when communicating online especially when many people are not using their first language. Instead of making assumptions, stay calm and ask clarifying questions. If you feel you can’t be patient or friendly, take a step back and respond later.\n",
      "  We’re all here to learn and share ideas. When you have critical feedback, focus on the ideas that others are sharing, not the person.\n",
      "  Low-level harassment is still harassment. Even minor or subtle put downs set a negative tone in our community that will alienate others.\n",
      "  We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n",
      "  Kaggle is a professional community of data scientists and machine learners; NSFW content does not have a home here and will be removed.\n",
      "  Progression manipulation includes any behaviors that intend to game Kaggle’s reputation system. They harm the fairness and quality of the community and are forbidden on our platform. Off-topic self promotion, upvote collusion, plagiarism, and cheating are some (but not all) examples of progression manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Self Promotion\n",
      "  If you want to promote your own work in the form of sharing links to your profile, notebooks or datasets, you may do so in either the Accomplishments forum or in the “sharing-projects” and “celebration” Discord channels. (For those interested in joining our Discord community, please see this (https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/429933) forum post.) Sharing self-promoting posts in other forums or in comments may result in the removal of that content and a warning may be issued to the author.\n",
      "  Requesting upvotes or suggesting that other users should view or “check out” your work is considered upvote begging and is not allowed. Comments or posts of this nature may be removed and a warning may be issued to the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Forum Posts\n",
      "  It is appropriate to share lists, articles, how-tos, industry advice, etc. in the forums, so long as your post:\n",
      "  The discussion forums are primarily a place for our community to connect, learn from each other, and get answers to specific questions. When AI tools are used to create content that is incorrect, off topic or spammy, it harms our community and makes our discussion forums a less useful place for everyone. In order to preserve the purpose of our community, we must insist that generative models and other AI tools only be used for discussion posts and comments in the following capacities:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enforcement and Reporting\n",
      "  If you see something that you feel violates these guidelines please bring it to our attention using the flag option on messages and topics. We take your reports very seriously. If you have a concern that you think merits additional attention, you should report it to moderation@kaggle.com. All reports will be kept confidential.\n",
      "  The Kaggle team determines whether content is appropriate and we will make a decision internally. If we’ve found a violation of our community guidelines, repercussions may include (but are not limited to):\n",
      "  A warning will be issued as a courtesy to any user who violates Kaggle's community guidelines and may be supplemented with the removal of content associated with the violation. Examples of behavior warranting a warning include but are not limited to upvote begging, spam posting, plagiarism and attempts to manipulate Kaggle's progression system.\n",
      "  If more than one warning is issued, your account may be suspended (i.e., suspensions will only be issued to users who have previously received a warning). A user's access to Kaggle will be revoked for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the offense. Please note: we reserve the right to suspend your account without warning in more severe cases.\n",
      "  More than two account suspensions in the lifetime of an account may result in an immediate account ban. Additionally, immediate account bans may be issued to those who create duplicate accounts, post NSFW content, have usernames containing offensive language, post excessive spam or abuse kernel resources such as free storage. Bans are considered final.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
